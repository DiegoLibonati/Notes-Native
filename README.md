# Notes-Native-App

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository on your computer using: `git clone URL`.
2. Go to the APP directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. If you have expo and an Android simulator installed, you can run the app with the command `npm start` and select the desired option.

- If you don't have expo and an Android simulator installed, search for a tutorial on YouTube.

## Description

This native application is a notepad. It allows you to add notes, view these notes one by one by tapping on the note to be viewed. Additionally, the creation date, a title, and a content of the note can be viewed. While in the selected note, you can delete that note from all existing notes. Also, thanks to a component that I created, which is a list of checkboxes, you can filter by different filters such as date, title, or description, displaying only the filtered notes if it matches the filter and what you are looking to filter.
